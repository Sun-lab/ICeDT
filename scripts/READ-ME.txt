File Description:

[1] EPIC_Extract.R:
	Contains two functions [EPIC_Extract() and scaleCounts()]. 
	
	- EPIC_Extract():
	   EPIC_Extract runs the EPIC model
	   fit but has been edited to output the utilized reference expression matrix and mixture
	   expression profiles so that ICeDT and EPIC can be fit to the same data using the same data.
	   Returns the EPIC fit and edited to provided:
	
	   $bulk: The mixture expression matrix (nG by nS)
	   $ref : The utilized version of the TRef matrix

	- scaleCounts():
	   This function was designed by the EPIC authors (Racle et al) to renormalize mixture 
	   and reference data across common genes. It is presented unedited but must be utilized
	   outside the EPIC package as the function was not made available to users.

[2] EPIC_Variance_Weights.R:
	Provides some sample code for using the reference data utilized by EPIC to produce
	variance weights that can be used with ICeD-T. Additional commentary provided in the code.

[3] TRef_purData.RData:
	Contains the purified reference sample data utilized by EPIC, one matrix per cell type with
	expressions across 23681 genes and 7 cell types. Data is stored as:
	
	- XXXdat_r:
	   Each XXX will define a different cell type (B=B-cells, CAF = Cancer Associated
	   fibroblasts, CD4 = CD4+ T-cells, CD8 = CD8+ T-cells, E = Endothelials, M = Macrophages,
	   NK = Natural Killer cells.
